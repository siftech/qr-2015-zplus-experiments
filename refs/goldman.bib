  abstract =	 {The CIRCA system automatically synthesizes hard
                  real-time discrete event controllers from plant and
                  environment descriptions. CIRCA's
                  automatically-synthesized controllers provide
                  guaranteed real-time performance and safety
                  preservation in adversarial, non-closed-world
                  domains. By separating controller construction from
                  formal controller verification, CIRCA makes
                  controller synthesis decisions in a time-abstract
                  state space that is quite compact. However,
                  controller verification requires a more complete
                  consideration of time, to make real-time performance
                  guarantees. By retaining information between
                  verifications of partial controllers during the
                  controller synthesis process, the incremental
                  verification methods that we present here
                  dramatically reduce the complexity of controller
                  synthesis. We provide formal characterizations of
                  our incremental verification technique and
                  performance results demonstrating up to a 97\%
                  reduction in controller synthesis time using these

    This document formalizes and discusses the implementation of a
    new, more efficient probabilistic plan recognition algorithm
    called Yet Another Probabilistic Plan Recognizer (\textsc{Yappr}).
    \textsc{Yappr}\ is based on weighted model counting, building its
    models using string rewriting rather than tree adjunction or other
    tree building methods used in previous work.  Since model
    construction is often the most computationally expensive part of
    such algorithms, this results in significant reductions in the
    algorithm's runtime.}}

  abstract =     {We are developing real-time planning and control systems that
                  allow a single human operator to control a team of unmanned
                  aerial vehicles (UAVs). If the operator requests more tasks
                  than can be immediately addressed by the available UAVs, our
                  planning system must choose which goals to try to achieve, and
                  which to postpone for later effort. To make this
                  decision-making easily understandable and controllable, we
                  allow the user to assign strict priorities to goals, ensuring
                  that if a goal is assigned the highest priority, the system
                  will use every resource available to try to build a successful
                  plan to achieve that goal. In this paper we show how unique
                  features of the SHOP2 hierarchical task network planner permit
                  an elegant implementation of this priority queue
                  behavior. Although this paper is primarily about the technique
                  itself, rather than SHOP2's performance, we assess the
                  scalability of this priority queue approach and discuss
                  potential directions for improvement, as well as more general
                  forms of meta-control within SHOP2 domains.},
