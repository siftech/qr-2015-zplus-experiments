		  Pearl argues that this doesn't correctly take into account
		  causality and dependence and argues that J-conditioning
		  can best be achieved through virtual evidence on a 
		  graphical model of the distribution and its dependencies.
		  He gives examples where observations give information
		  about propositions and also {\it create} dependencies,
		  hence leading J-conditioning to absurd conclusions.
		  Pearl also dismisses minimum divergence as a way of 
		  choosing the distribution posterior to J-conditioning.}

		 important problem is to find the maximum a-posteriori
		 probability (MAP) instantiation of all the random
		 variables given the evidence. Numerous researchers
		 using such models employ some graph representation for
		 the distributions, such as a Bayesian belief network.
		 This representation simplifies the complexity of
		 specifying the distributions from exponential in n, the
		 number of variables in the model, to linear in n, in
		 many interesting cases. We show, however, that finding
		 the MAP is NP-hard in the general case when these
		 representations are used, even if the size of the
		 representation happens to be linear in n. Furthermore,
		 minor modifications to the proof show that the problem
		 remains NP-hard for various restrictions of the
		 topology of the graphs. The same technique can be
		 applied to the results of a related paper (by Cooper),
		 to further restrict belief network topology in the
		 proof that probabilistic inference is NP-hard.",

  abstract =     "Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) MDPs is a problem class widely
                  studied in AI, especially in probabilistic planning. They
                  describe a wide range of scenarios but make the restrictive
                  assumption that the goal is reachable from any state, i.e.,
                  that dead-end states do not exist. Because of this, SSPs are
                  unable to model various scenarios that may have catastrophic
                  events (e.g., an airplane possibly crashing if it flies into a
                  storm). Even though MDP algorithms have been used for solving
                  problems with dead ends, a principled theory of SSP extensions
                  that would allow dead ends, including theoretically sound
                  algorithms for solving such MDPs, has been lacking. In this
                  paper, we propose three new MDP classes that admit dead ends
                  under increasingly weaker assumptions. We present Value
                  Iteration-based as well as the more efficient heuristic search
                  algorithms for optimally solving each class, and explore
                  theoretical relationships between these classes. We also
                  conduct a preliminary empirical study comparing the
                  performance of our algorithms on different MDP classes,
                  especially on scenarios with unavoidable dead ends."
