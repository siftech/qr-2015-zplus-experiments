                  central facts about temporal CSPs (TCSP). Notably,
                  defines the Simple Temporal Network (STN), a TCSP
                  where each constraint affects only one quantity
                  (time point difference): i.e., there are no
                  disjunctive constraints. Shows the usefulness of
                  shortest-path algorithms for STNs. Explains some
                  solutions for full TCSPs. These are not of enormous
                  {\em direct} utility if you're building a planner or
                  scheduler, because such software typically involves
                  solving other constraints simultaneously with the
                  TCSP. But all the pieces are there --- it's an
                  engineering matter to extend them to scheduling or
                  planning. Later researchers provide more information
