                 for modeling attacks against computer network and its
                 software implementation on the basis of a multi-agent
                 architecture. The model of an attack is considered as a
                 complex process of contest of adversary entities those
                 are malefactor or team of malefactors, on the one hand,
                 and network security system implementing a security
                 policy, on the other hand. The paper focuses on the
                 conceptual justification of the chosen approach,
                 specification of the basic components composing attack
                 model, formal frameworks for specification of the above
                 components and their interaction in simulation
                 procedure. The peculiarities of the developed approach
                 are the followings: (1) malefactor's intention-centric
                 attack modeling; (2) multi-level attack specification;
                 (3) ontology-based distributed attack model
                 structuring; (4) attributed stochastic $LL(2)$
                 context-free grammar for formal specification of attack
                 scenarios and its components (``simple attacks'');
                 (5) using operation of formal grammar substitution for
                 specification of multi-level structure of attacks; (6)
                 state machine-based formal grammar framework
                 implementation; (7) on-line generation of the
                 malefactor's activity resulting from the reaction of
                 the attacked network security system.",
