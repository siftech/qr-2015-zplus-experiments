		 extensively in Artificial Intelligence over the last

		 knowledge-based systems and are used to develop various
		 real-life applications. The Description Logic Handbook
		 provides a thorough account of the subject, covering
		 all aspects of research in this field, namely: theory,
		 implementation, and applications. Its appeal will be
		 broad, ranging from more theoretically-oriented
		 readers, to those with more practically-oriented
		 interests who need a sound and modern understanding of
		 knowledge representation systems based on Description
		 Logics. The chapters are written by some of the most
		 prominent researchers in the field, introducing the
		 basic technical material before taking the reader to
		 the current state of the subject, and including
		 comprehensive guides to the literature. In sum, the
		 book will serve as a unique reference for the subject,
		 and can also be used for self-study or in conjunction
		 with Knowledge Representation and Artificial
		 Intelligence courses.",
