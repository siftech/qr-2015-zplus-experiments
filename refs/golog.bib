                  initial state, and does \emph{not} cover open
                  universes of objects. The set of objects must, as

                  technique for quantification is essentially that of
                  computing a \emph{universal base}, used by
                  \sc{Ucpop}. The authors do regression with

                 language ConGolog (developed at the University of
                 Toronto) by adding to it a new construct which we call
                 the htn-construct. The new construct improves ConGolog
                 by allowing easy specification of non-determinism when
                 a partial ordering between a set of actions needs to be
                 maintained. Furthermore, it allows temporal constraints
                 to be specified easily. We present an implementation of
                 the htn-construct in PROLOG which can be directly added
                 to PROLOG implementations of ConGolog interpreters.",

                  is to handle partial ordering; everything else works
                  already. One thing that seemed odd to me was that
                  they formalize the process using the Trans
                  relationship, and have all of the reduction of
                  schemas be done in the initial situation. That's
                  reasonably ok semantics, but it means that they need
                  a very large additional set of semantics to handle
                  the progression of the state through execution of
                  the HTN planner, which seems inelegant.",

                 high-level programming in the situation calculus

                 (Levesque et al. 1997; De Giacomo, Lesperance, \&
                 Levesque 2000) and 2) to illustrate our approach with a
                 ConGolog encoding of a logistics domain HTN-planning
                 problem. The Golog/ConGolog languages have been
                 extended to deal with explicit time, sensing actions,
                 exogenous events, execution monitoring, incomplete
                 knowledge of the initial state, stochastic actions and
                 others. Thus the range of problems that can be tackled
                 with this approach is potentially much larger. As an
                 example, we modified the logistics domain encoding to
                 execute on-line and deal with run-time exogenous
                 delivery requests",

                  for example, method choice is handled using guarded
                  branches, and partial orders are handled within
                  standard Golog procs, with interrupts that simulate
                  protections."
