		 best explanation for a set of facts by finding a
		 minimal cost proof for the facts. The costs are
		 computed by summing the costs of the assumptions
		 necessary for the proof plus the cost of the rules. We
		 examine existing methods for constructing explanations
		 (proofs), as a minimization problem on a DAG (directed
		 acyclic graph). We then define a probabilistic
		 semantics for the costs, and prove the equivalence of
		 the cost minimization problem to the Bayesian network
		 MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) solution of the
		 system. A simple best-first algorithm for finding
		 least-cost proofs is presented, and possible
		 improvements are suggested. The semantics of cost-based
		 abduction for complete models are then generalized to
		 handle negation. This, in turn, allows us to apply the
		 best-first search algorithm as a novel way of computing
		 MAP assignments to belief networks that can enumerate
		 assignments in order of decreasing probability. An
		 important point is that improvement results for the
		 best-first search algorithm carry over to the
		 computation of MAPs.",
