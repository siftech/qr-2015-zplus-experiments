  abstract =	"Notions of signature and anomaly have formed the basis
		 of useful methods in cyber defense, but even in
		 combination provide only weak evidence for recognizing
		 many events of interest. One can recognize many
		 important events without requiring signatures of
		 specific ways the events can take place and without
		 treating every anomalous behavior as an event. We
		 describe an approach to event recognition that subsumes
		 and extends signature and anomaly methods by starting
		 from a richer language for characterizing events. This
		 paper explains how recognition methods based on this
		 richer event-characterization language offer means for
		 overcoming the limitations constraining signature and
		 anomaly methods.",
