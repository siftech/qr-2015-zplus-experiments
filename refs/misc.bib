                 and clock differences. 1 Introduction The basic problem
                 we are trying to tackle is the combination BDD's and
                 DBM's (difference bound matrices) in order to allow a
                 completely BDD-based approach to the verification of
                 continuous real-time systems. Early approaches in this
                 direction include [WTD95] and [Bal96]. Another
                 inspiration for this work comes from [ST98]. Some of
                 the ideas come from the implementation of a decision
                 algorithm for timed bisimulation ([WL97]). 2 Definition
                 of CDD's We assume a finite set of real-valued clocks C
                 = fX 1 ; : : : ; X k g. We are interested in a data
                 structure to represent and manipulate sets of possible
                 values of these clocks. In particular, we shall confine
                 ourselves to sets being the finite unions of simple
                 convex polyhedra. The simple convex polyhedra are
                 described by bounds on the ind...",

                  reduction method for timed systems based on a
                  local-time semantics for networks of timed
                  automata. The main idea is to remove the implicit
                  clocksynchronization between processes in a network
                  by letting local clocks in each process advance
                  independently of clocks in other processes, and by
                  requiring that two processes resynchronize their
                  local time scales whenever they communicate. A
                  symbolic version of this new semantics is developed
                  in terms of predicate transformers, whichenjoys the
                  desired property that two predicate transformers are
                  independent if they correspond to disjoint
                  transitions in di#erent processes. Thus we can apply
                  standard partial order reduction techniques to the
                  problem of checking reachability for timed systems,
                  whichavoid exploration of unnecessary interleavings
                  of independent transitions. The price is that wemust
                  introduce extra machinery to perform the
                  resynchronization operations on local
                  clocks. Finally,..."

                  Krogh's group. These are hybrid systems formalized
                  in a bit more of a linear-algebra/continuous control
                  framework, rather than in the automata theoretic
                  style of Henzinger. The approach is based on
                  synthesizing a discrete state machine that
                  over-approximates the hybrid system, and then
                  generating a controller for that system. This is
                  interesting, but more limited than the Wong-Toi
                  approach, which is able to set parameters in the
                  process of synthesis: here all the threshold points
                  must be given. They present details of the
                  over-approximation, which preserves safety, and they
                  give a condition that's sufficient for producing
                  liveness, as well, making the over-approximation
                  acceptable. The approximation process is based on
                  building discrete systems based on longer and longer
                  strings of events and control actions, until the
                  discrete system either has an acceptable controller
                  or converges to the discrete system generated by the
                  events of the underlying hybrid system (at which
                  point, if there's no good controller, we'd know it
                  was hopeless).}

                 verification tools to industrial-size systems is the
                 excessive amount of memory required during the
                 state-space exploration of a model. In the setting of
                 real-time, this problem of state-explosion requires
                 extra attention as information must be kept not only on
                 the discrete control structure but also on the values
                 of continuous clock variables. In this paper, we
                 exploit Clock Difference Diagrams, CDD's, a BDD-like
                 data-structure for representing and effectively
                 manipulating certain non-convex subsets of the
                 Euclidean space, notably those encountered during
                 verification of timed automata. A version of the
                 real-time verification tool UPPAAL using CDD's as a
                 compact data-structure for storing explored symbolic
                 states has been implemented. Our experimental results
                 demonstrate significant space-savings: for eight
                 industrial examples, the savings are in average 42%
                 with moderate increase in runtime. We further report on
                 how the symbolic state-space exploration itself may be
                 carried out using CDD's.",

  abstract =     "Normalized compression distance (NCD) is a parameter-free,
                  feature-free, alignment-free, similarity measure between a
                  pair of finite objects based on compression. However, it is
                  not sufficient for all applications. We propose an NCD of
                  finite multisets (a.k.a. multiples) of finite objects that is
                  also a metric. Previously, attempts to obtain such an NCD
                  failed. We cover the entire trajectory from theoretical
                  underpinning to feasible practice. The new NCD for multisets
                  is applied to retinal progenitor cell classification questions
                  and to related synthetically generated data that were earlier
                  treated with the pairwise NCD. With the new method we achieved
                  significantly better results. Similarly for questions about
                  axonal organelle transport. We also applied the new NCD to
                  handwritten digit recognition and improved classification
                  accuracy significantly over that of pairwise NCD by
                  incorporating both the pairwise and NCD for multisets. In the
                  analysis we use the incomputable Kolmogorov complexity that
                  for practical purposes is approximated from above by the
                  length of the compressed version of the file involved, using a
                  real-world compression program. Index Terms--- Normalized
