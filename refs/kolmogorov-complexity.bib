  abstract =	"Normalized compression distance (NCD) is a
		 parameter-free, feature-free, alignment-free,
		 similarity measure between a pair of finite objects
		 based on compression. However, it is not sufficient for
		 all applications. We propose an NCD of finite multisets
		 (a.k.a. multiples) of finite objects that is also a
		 metric. Previously, attempts to obtain such an NCD
		 failed. We cover the entire trajectory from theoretical
		 underpinning to feasible practice. The new NCD for
		 multisets is applied to retinal progenitor cell
		 classification questions and to related synthetically
		 generated data that were earlier treated with the
		 pairwise NCD. With the new method we achieved
		 significantly better results. Similarly for questions
		 about axonal organelle transport. We also applied the
		 new NCD to handwritten digit recognition and improved
		 classification accuracy significantly over that of
		 pairwise NCD by incorporating both the pairwise and NCD
		 for multisets. In the analysis we use the incomputable
		 Kolmogorov complexity that for practical purposes is
		 approximated from above by the length of the compressed
		 version of the file involved, using a real-world
		 compression program. Index Terms--- Normalized

  abstract =	"We present a new method for clustering based on
		 compression. The method doesn't use subject-specific
		 features or background knowledge, and works as follows:
		 First, we determine a parameter-free, universal,
		 similarity distance, the normalized compression
		 distance or NCD , computed from the lengths of
		 compressed data files (singly and in pairwise
		 concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical
		 clustering method. The NCD is not restricted to a
		 specific application area, and works across application
		 area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the
		 normalised information distance, co-developed by one of
		 the authors, is provably optimal. However, the
		 optimality comes at the price of using the
		 non-computable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We
		 propose axioms to capture the real-world setting, and
		 show that the NCD approximates optimality. To extract a
		 hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we
		 determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet
		 method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method
		 is implemented and available as public software, and is
		 robust under choice of different compressors. To
		 substantiate our claims of universality and robustness,
		 we report evidence of successful application in areas
		 as diverse as genomics, virology, languages,
		 literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and
		 combinations of objects from completely different
		 domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block
		 sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new
		 evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution,
		 based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the
		 Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against
		 the Theria hypothesis.",
