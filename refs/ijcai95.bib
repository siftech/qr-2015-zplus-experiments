	CROSSREF = {ijcai95},
	ANNOTE = {The authors extend the situation calculus to cover 
		  actions that contain noisy sensors.  The work is a
		  further extension from Scherl and Levesque's 1993 
		  work, that adds a modal logic-like belief operator to
		  the situation calculus.  The authors use Bacchus' 
		  probabilistic logic to permit
		  a probability distribution over the belief-accessible

	CROSSREF = {ijcai95},
	ANNOTE = {Approach is to describe actions in terms of state 
		  specifications.  I couldn't be bothered to read this
		  carefully, since no comparisons were made between 
		  Baral's language and other, more accepted languages
		  for action description, in particular the situation

@INPROCEEDINGS{Fink:ijcai95,
	AUTHOR = {Eugene Fink and Qiang Yang},
	TITLE = "Planning with primary effects: experiments and analysis",
	PAGES = {1606--1611},
	CROSSREF = {ijcai95},
	ANNOTE = {The authors conduct some experiments on the effects of the
		  technique of specifying primary effects for planner
		  actions.  This means identifying certain effects of actions
		  as primary and others as side effects.  One restricts the
		  planner to only add actions to the plan to achieve their 
		  primary effects.  The authors propose a method for 
		  automatically identifying the primary effects.  The work
		  seems sensible, but not earth-shattering.}

@INPROCEEDINGS{Laborie:ijcai95,

	TITLE = "Planning with Sharable Resource Constraints",
	PAGES = {1643--1649},
	NOTE = {},
	CROSSREF = {ijcai95},
	ANNOTE = {A treatment of sharable (metric) resources in a 
		  partial-order planner.  Their planner has two support
		  components: a TMM and a 
		  variable constraint manager.  They define a special
		  Possible Intersection Graph data structure for users
		  of resources.  This is a graph with nodes for each 
		  resource requirement.  Out of this graph, they derive
		  minimum critical sets(MCSes) --- a set of 
		  possibly-intersecting
		  resource consumers whose consumption exceeds supply and 
		  which is minimal in the sense that removal of one of the 
		  consumers is sufficient to cause the resource consumption
		  to fall below the acceptable level.  A problem for them is
		  that they will generate far too many MCS-candidates.}
