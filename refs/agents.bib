	ANNOTE = {Kuokka and Harada propose {\em matchmaking\/} as an
		  information-brokerage protocol for multi-agent systems.
		  They point out that existing information-getting schemes
		  put the burden on information-seekers, rather than allowing
		  information providers to be active partners.  Further, 
		  many of the information broking schemes rely on exhaustive
		  search of information repositories.  This is expensive and
		  the ``maps'' are prone to be out of date.
		  
		  As an alternative, they propose a protocol involving 
		  special matchmaking agents that are able to either broker
		  information or ``matchmake'' connections between 
		  consumers and producers and then step out of the way.  The 
		  matchmakers coordinate requests from consumers with 
		  update messages from producers.}
